    <h2>Downtown Disney</h2>
    <ul class="lastsection">
        <li> There are lots of stores to browse through and restaurants to eat in. Take some time to browse.
        </li>

        <li>The Lego store is cool. Even if your kids arenâ€™t into Legos, stop by to see all the characters made out
            of Legos. The dragon from sleeping beauty is my favorite.
        </li>

        <li>World of Disney is the biggest store in the park. For the most part, all of the stores carry similar
            merchandise, so you may be able to knock out a big chunk of shopping at this store.
