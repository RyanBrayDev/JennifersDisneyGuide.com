        <p>Let’s start with California Adventure. I have been there six times since the year it
          opened, and already a lot has changed. So, my suggestions will not be exhaustive, but it
          will speak to what I know.

        <h2>A Crazy Start</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>This is THE hotspot right now, and for good reason. It is just awesome. To get a
            Fast Pass for the Radiator Springs Racers, you have to get in line first thing in
            the morning. I would get there at least 30 minutes before the park opens. One person
            should take your whole party’s tickets to get the passes so that you are not
            all trying to stay together in the crowd. When I was there, the FastPasses were gone
            for the whole day by 10:00 in the morning, so do this first. The ride is absolutely
            worth it. While the one adult waits for FastPasses, the others should head straight
            down to the Hollywood Pictures
            Backlot area and meet Olaf. The lines will get very long later, and we walked right
            up. Next, head over to the animation building
            to meet Elsa and Anna. These lines can be RIDICULOUS, and sometimes they will only
            allow those with FastPasses. On the off chance that no one is in line, they might
            let you in, so ask. If not, as soon as
            the adult with the Radiator Springs Racers FastPasses gets back, get FastPasses to
            meet the princesses. The Frozen FastPasses are some of
            the only ones that allow you to hold more than one at a time, so don’t worry about
            overlapping with your Racers times. The same is true of the World of Color
            FastPasses, which I will come to next.
          </li>

          <li>As soon as you have finished the Frozen section (or gotten a FastPass for later),
            head around Condor Flats to the World of Color FastPass line by Grizzly River Falls.
            If you love Disney shows, this one is the best, but the circumstances of getting a
            spot are a little crazy, so make sure you’re into it. Get the FastPasses for
            whichever show is still available, and plan to get in the appropriate color line
            about an hour before show time (your FastPass will be assigned a color area). Ask
            one of the attendants at the FastPass distribution machines for help if you are
            confused. If all has gone well, the park should have been open about 20-30 minutes.
            Do not try to hop on Soarin’ Over California or any of the other cool rides.
            Instead, proceed, as quickly as you can, to the Paradise Pier area and go straight
            to . . .
          </li>

          <li>Toy Story Mania. This ride is so fun, but there is not FastPass option, and the line
            will get really, really long very quickly. If it is under an hour, you are lucky.
            Get in line and enjoy!
          </li>

          <li>Now, the craziest part of the day is complete, so check the times on your
            FastPasses, go to anything that is open, and check out the other great options for
            the day.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="sectionCarsLand" class="toc-content">
        <h2>Cars Land</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Take a minute to just look around this place. If you or your kids were a fan of the
            original movie, you will be so happy here. It honestly feels like you are there. It
            is also worth coming back to in the evening when all the neon is lit up.
          </li>

          <li>Mater’s Junkyard Jamboree is really fun, even though it doesn’t look like it. The
            line moves pretty quickly. While you’re in line, check all the decorations on the
            walls. They are amazing props from Mater’s Tall Tales.
          </li>

          <li>Eat at Flo’s V8 Café if you can. The food is one of the better options at
            Disneyland!
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="sectionCondorFlats" class="toc-content">
        <h2>Condor Flats</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Get a Fast Pass for Soaring Over California (unless the line is short; then just
            jump on!) as soon as you are able (either once your Racers FastPass start time, or
            at the time noted on the bottom of the Racers FastPass). The Fast Passes for this
            ride sell out early and for good reason. It is one of the best rides in this park.
            If your kids are too little to ride, take turns waiting with them while the other
            rides. (The staff will assist you in this at the end of the line on all their
            rides.) I can’t express enough how cool this ride is.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="sectionHollywood" class="toc-content">
        <h2>Hollywood Pictures Backlot</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Head straight to the Tower of Terror. This is an amazing thrill ride, but it can get a
            long line fast. I have also been on it when we could just walk right on, so give it a
            try. If you aren’t holding a Fast Pass for Soarin’ Over California, get one for this, or
            jump on if the line is short.
          </li>
          <li>After getting your Fast Pass or riding the ride, go back to the Hollywood Pictures
            Backlot. Go straight to the Disney Animation building. Go to the Sorcerer’s Workshop.
            Cool hands-on stuff for all of you to do, and you can also find out which Disney
            character you are most like when you are in the Beast’s library. If you want to go
            through the rest of this building now, knock yourself out; however, this may be a good
            place to come back to when it gets hot. Turtle Talk with Crush from Finding Nemo is
            great interactive fun for the kids, and it runs every 20-30 minutes throughout the day.
          </li>

          <li>Next, go over to the theater. Last time I was there, there was a Frozen show. Every time
            “Let It Go” comes on in a show, parade, whatever, you will hear gasps as everyone loses
            their shit and little girls start singing along at the top of their lungs.
          </li>

          <li>Check to see what is showing at the Hyperion Theater and when. Last time I was there, it
            was an Aladdin show, and it was awesome. However, if you get there late, you will be at
            the end of the line, and then you will climb TONS of stairs. Once inside, however, there
            is a 30-45 minute show in air conditioning. Again, this could be a good thing to do when
            it gets hot. (There may not be a show, as I heard they are getting rid of Aladdin to put
            in a more permanent, elaborate Frozen show. Cue shit-losing and singing.)
          </li>

          <li>Keep an eye out for characters. They pop up all over this area. Also, check your map to
            see when and where they are scheduled to be. You will mostly find the Pixar characters
            and those from Disney Junior.
          </li>

          <li>Some of the shops are great in this area. Take some time to browse.</li>

          <li>If you picked up a Fast Pass, be sure to go back during your scheduled time.</li>

          <li>There is a ride for Monster’s Inc., and it is great fun for kids and fans of the movie.
            Very tame.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="sectionGoldenState" class="toc-content">
        <h2>Golden State</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I don’t know if kids will be big enough to ride the Grizzly River Run. It is a pretty
            typical raft ride, so decide for yourselves what you want to do. If you decide to ride
            it, prepare to get very wet. My son loved it, and we were so hot that day, it was a
            welcome refreshment.
          </li>

          <li>Redwood Creek Challenge will give all of you, especially little ones, a chance to burn
            some energy. There is also a little show and the opportunity to meet the characters of
            Brother Bear and Up.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="sectionBugsLife" class="toc-content">
        <h2>Bug's Life</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The Bug’s Life area is a scrapbooker’s dream. This a great area for kids and adults to
            ride some fairly tame rides together, but take some time to look around at the way the
            rides are “constructed.” For example, the bugs have used pencils for direction signs on
            the bumper cars, Chinese food containers to hold people, etc. Way fun, and lots of areas
            to take pictures of the little ones. I really enjoyed this area. There is another 3-D
            show called “It’s Tough to be a Bug.” This one could really scare little kids who are
            afraid of spiders and bugs, so you might have an adult go first to see if the littler
            folks can handle it.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="sectionParadisePier" class="toc-content">
        <h2>Paradise Pier</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>All Disney shows are fun. They are also good ways to rest your feet.</li>

          <li>Do NOT miss the Pixar Block Party Bash parade. This one is lots of fun, and kids get to
            be part of the action at different spots on the route (check your map for exact
            locations). Getting there a little early for a seat is a good idea. Get a hot dog or ice
            cream cone, and just sit. If there are still tables outside of Baker’s Field Bakery and
            Burrr Bank Ice Cream, try to get one closest to the street. Perfect spot. Also, the area
            near the end of A Bug’s Life will usually fill up last, and it is a performance spot, so
            you can always check there.
          </li>

          <li>World of Color is a totally mind-blowing show. You can get Fast Pass tickets for
            specific viewing spots, or better spots for various meal deals (the picnics are the
            cheapest). Check at the information booth for more options.
