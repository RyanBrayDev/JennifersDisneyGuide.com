        <p>Okay, I must admit, Disneyland is really my area of expertise. The following may seem a little
          obsessive, but I don’t care… at all. I am operating under the assumption that you will be arriving
          when the gates open. If you take advantage of an early opening, adjust accordingly. No matter what,
          get there no later than opening. You can always take a nap later, but getting there early will save
          you line headaches overall. Plus, there are usually lots of characters out in the morning right
          inside the gates. Have your autograph books ready.
        </p>

      <div id="sectionFantasyland" class="toc-content">
        <h2>Fantasyland</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I know what is going to happen. You are going to walk in and immediately want to start browsing
            through all of the Main Street shops. Don’t! Move quickly toward the castle, and don’t stop
            until you’re on the other side.
          </li>

          <li>You are now in my favorite part of Disneyland, and it will probably look a little empty. That’s
            good. Go straight to Peter Pan and get on. This line will get obnoxiously long later (an hour or
            more is not unheard of). This is my favorite ride of all! Look for the little cars moving on the
            streets when you fly over London!
          </li>

          <li>Next, hit the rest of the “movie rides.” Snow White’s Scary Adventure, Pinocchio’s Daring
            Journey (look for the Blue Fairy at the very end. She disappears quickly), Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride
            (such fun) and Alice in Wonderland.
          </li>

          <li>Next, get in line for Dumbo. This is another one that will get long quickly.</li>

          <li>Jump on Casey Jr. Circus Train. If you sit in the car behind the engine, you will hear it talk
            as it goes up and down the little hills.
          </li>

          <li>Go over to Matterhorn Bobsleds if you think everyone can handle it. If you haven’t ridden it in
            a few years, they updated the Yeti, and the turns are a bit harder. This one can get to over an
            hour wait before noon.
          </li>

          <li>Next, hit King Arthur’s Carousel and the Mad Tea Party.</li>

          <li>Stop by Mad Hatter and get your ears. If you don’t all get ears, I will forever consider you to
            be shitty parents. Remember, getting your names on the back is free!
          </li>

          <li>If the Storybook Land Canal Boats are open, get in line. The whale looks scary, but it is
            actually very cute. Little kids will most likely like it. If it is not open yet, note what time
            it does open, and try to get back then.
          </li>

          <li>Head over to It’s a Small World.</li>

          <li>Pass through Fantasyland at least once after dark. Stop at the entrance to Peter Pan, turn
            around, and watch the window above Snow White/Pinocchio. Keep watching. There will be a scary
            surprise.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="sectionMickeysToontown" class="toc-content">
        <h2>Mickey's Toontown</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>It is a natural transition to now go to Toontown. Go straight to Mickey’s house. You have to
            make your way all the way through to the barn and then you will be in line to meet the main
            mouse! Let’s face it, that’s the real reason you came. Hopefully, it will still be fairly early
            in the morning and the line won’t be too long. If it is, you may want to check back some other
            time. I wouldn’t wait more than about 20 minutes.
          </li>

          <li>Next you should go to Minnie’s house and meet her as well. Again, judge the line yourself. Keep
            an eye out for the other members of the fab five (Goofy, Donald, Pluto, Minnie and Mickey). They
            will be around.
          </li>

          <li>You may want to get in line for Roger Rabbit’s Car Toon Spin. A lot of kids today have no idea
            who he is or what the movie is about, so you can decide.
          </li>

          <li>Next, go to Gadget’s Go Coaster. This one is designed just for kids, but I still think it is
            kinda fun. Jackson loves it.
          </li>

          <li>That leaves Chip and Dale Treehouse, Donald’s Boat and Goofy’s House.</li>

          <li>There are lots of fun things to do. Encourage kids to try all the mailboxes. They say some funny
            things. Also, have them watch the upstairs window of the fire department while one of you rings
            the doorbell. There’s a fun surprise.
          </li>

        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="sectionTomorrowland" class="toc-content">
        <h2>Tomorrowland</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Autopia is fun and much improved. Kids will have fun driving the car.</li>

          <li>Captain EO has Michael Jackson in it. Need I say more?</li>

          <li>Star Tours is really fun, but it always makes Jason and I a little queasy. Still, it’s Star
            Wars, so it’s totally worth a little vomit. For the past year, it has been in 3-D, so it is
            awesome. By the way, there are 39 different scenarios, so if you ride it more than once, you
            will likely get a different ride. I also know that plans to add some scenes from The Force
            Awakens are set to launch any day. You might be in luck.
          </li>

          <li>Space Mountain is a great coaster that functions in the dark, and after a few years of
            refurbishment, it is new on the inside. You might want to get a FastPass.
          </li>

          <li>Astro Orbitor is very similar to Dumbo. Watch out for long lines.</li>

          <li>Buzz Lightyear’s Space Ranger Spin is fun, fun, fun! Kids and adults will love it because there
            is a competitive nature to the ride. As you attempt to defeat the Evil Emperor Zurg, you engage
            in a space battle, shooting small “Z” icons throughout the ride. Each car will keep score for
            its passengers. We rode this one several times, trash talkin’ all the way.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="sectionAdventureland" class="toc-content">
        <h2>Adventureland</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>The Jungle Cruise is one of the original classics. Don’t miss it.</li>

          <li>Tarzan’s Treehouse is fun to walk through. If you want to give a kid a little jump, tell her to
            touch the Jaguar’s nose. It will growl at her.
          </li>

          <li>Indiana Jones Adventure is super cool. Take turns waiting with children who are too little to
            ride. It is worth it! It may be smart to work in a Fast Pass.
          </li>

          <li>The Enchanted Tiki room, besides a quick thunderstorm, is lighthearted fun with animatronic
            birds and flowers. It is a good way to cool off and rest your feet. Some time while you are
            there, you have to buy a cup of the Dole Pineapple Whip they sell out front. It is so good; you
            will want to take a bath in it.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="sectionFrontierland" class="toc-content">
        <h2>Frontierland</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Big Thunder Mountain Railroad is a great coaster if the kiddos are up for it. Its lines are
            deceiving because they wrap around in every direction. A Fast Pass might be a good idea.
          </li>

          <li>Stop by the Frontierland Shootin’ Exposition. It is cheap fun, and you will feel like Jessie
            James when you are finished.
          </li>

          <li>The Mark Twain Riverboat and the Sailing Ship Columbia will take you on exactly the same ride,
            so it is really just a matter of deciding which ship you would rather sail on. If you have time
            later, you could always ride the other one.
          </li>

          <li>Rafts to Pirate Island were an unexpected treat. I thought it would be stupid, but once you are
            over there, there are caves, bridges, rocks to climb and trails to hike. This is a great place
            for kids to burn some energy, but I suggest going one day before lunch. There will be fewer
            people, and it won’t be so hot.
          </li>

          <li>At night, there should be a showing of Fantasmic, but I will save that for…</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="sectionNewOrleansSquare" class="toc-content">
        <h2>New Orleans Square</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>I put Fantasmic here because I know the perfect spot to watch this MUST SEE show. There is a
            walkway that connects Adventureland to New Orleans Square. When you stand on it, you look down
            on the entrance to Pirates of the Caribbean. About 45 minutes to an hour before the show starts,
            get a spot along the handrail, facing the water and Tom Sawyer’s Island. You will be above the
            rest of the crowd, and no one will stand in front of you. We usually get snacks/dinner and wait
            it out. You might want to bring a blanket, towels or jackets to sit on. DO NOT SKIP THIS SHOW!
            Note: They are now doing a FastPass for this show, and you can’t see it without one. See a Cast
            Member for best practices on this.
          </li>

          <li>All I can say about Pirates of the Caribbean is that last time Jason and I went to Disneyland,
            we rode it 5 times. It is that good. If you walk by and there is no line, ride it again. They
            have added some updates to go along with the movie.
          </li>

          <li>The Haunted Mansion is spooky fun, but the ghosts can look very real to little kids. Please
            don’t be that parent who makes their kid ride this even if she doesn’t want to. I always want to
            punch that parent. Also, if you go from October through December, the mansion is given a
            Nightmare Before Christmas facelift. I really enjoy it, but I also love that movie, so . . .
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="sectionCritterCountry" class="toc-content">
        <h2>Critter Country</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>There is a cute, fun Pooh ride. The line could be really long, so if you can, you may want to
            make this land your first on another morning. Pooh and the gang will probably be out for
            pictures, but I suggest meeting them at the character breakfast at the Plaza Inn instead.
          </li>

          <li>Splash Mountain rocks. Make kids ride it. For the most part, it is just a fun water ride through
            the briar patch. The drop is over before you know it, and they will stop crying eventually.
          </li>

          <li>Davy Crockett’s Explorer Canoes is just like the Mark Twain and the Columbia, except that you
            move the canoes along with paddles. I really like doing this, but some people find it boring.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="sectionMainStreet" class="toc-content">
        <h2>Main Street, U.S.A.</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>It is best to go back to Main Street when you are getting tired, need a break from the crowds or
            want to do a little shopping. Anything painted gold on the buildings is actually done with 14K
            gold paint. It helps give your photos a little extra sparkle. The same is true of C3PO in the
            entrance to Star Tours.
          </li>
          <li>The Main Street Vehicles (Fire Engine, Horse-Drawn Streetcars, Horseless Carriage, Omnibus) are
            fun to intersperse throughout your trip, or ride them back-to-back for about a half hour of
            relaxation.
          </li>

          <li>I really like Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln, but if you don’t like history, you might want to
            skip it. Lincoln is the first animatronic person ever created, and it is pretty cool to see him
            stand up and speak to you.
          </li>

          <li>Be sure to walk along the paths next to Sleeping Beauty’s Castle. Characters hide out here
            (including the princesses and Peter Pan, who distrusts adults and rarely looks them in the eye)
            and there is a neat set of Snow White statues on one side.
          </li>

          <li>Be sure to go to Tinker Bell’s area to meet her and the other fairies from Pixie Hollow.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div id="sectionEntertainment" class="toc-content">
        <h2>Entertainment</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>The best place to sit for the parades is on a long, built-in bench sort of across from the
            Matterhorn. You will be in the shade, and you won’t have to sit on the street curb. Arrive about
            an hour before the parade to get a seat. Jason usually holds our seat while I poke around in the
            Main Street shops.
          </li>

          <li>DO NOT MISS FANTASMIC!
          </li>

          <li>The new fireworks show is jaw-dropping-amazing! The best place to see the fireworks display is
            in the middle of Main Street or near the castle in the street, but there will be a lot of
            people, so they may get in small children’s way. The most important thing is that you get a spot
            that allows you to clearly see the top of the Matterhorn and the top of Sleeping Beauty’s
            Castle. Tinker Bell and other characters will take flight about half way through the show. You
            couldn’t pay me enough to have that job! Also, if they have a special holiday fireworks show on
            another night or time, try to catch it, too. They will be different, but also amazing.
          </li>

          <li>If your kids like Star Wars, the Jedi Training show is fun. On slow days, almost all kids are
            selected, and in the end, they each get a chance to fight Vader or Darth Maul with a light
            saber. Jackson kicked Vader’s ass, and it was my proudest moment as a mom. The best chance of
            having your kiddo chosen is to have them wear something that stands out (Jackson had a Broncos
            shirt) and make sure they show their enthusiasm by jumping around and being “worthy.”
