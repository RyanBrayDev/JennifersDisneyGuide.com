        There are lots of stores to browse through and restaurants to eat in. Take some time to browse.

        The Lego store is cool. Even if your kids arenâ€™t into Legos, stop by to see all the characters made out
        of Legos. The dragon from sleeping beauty is my favorite.

        World of Disney is the biggest store in the park. For the most part, all of the stores carry similar
        merchandise, so you may be able to knock out a big chunk of shopping at this store.
