    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>

    <p>I have rejoiced in Disneyland both with and without children, so some of my plans are based on both kinds of
      trips. I
      have been to The Happiest Place on Earth ten times since 1994, and I have rarely waited in line more than 20
      minutes, and never more than 30 minutes (except when Radiator Spring Racers broke down). I know that
      Birnbaum’s
      Guide may differ in its suggestions, so go with what you’re most comfortable with. Having said that, I am
      right.</p>

    <h2>Hot App</h2>
    <p>There is a great app from Disney for your phones that allows you to check the wait times for rides in both
      parks,
      gives you character greeting spots, park hours, maps, etc. It can come in really handy when you’re trying to
      decide
      what to do next. Sometimes, I check it when I’m in Colorado just to daydream about what I could be riding.
    </p>

    <h2>Warning</h2>
    <p>It would be a good idea to check out Disneyland’s website before you leave to see which rides will be shut
      down
      for
      refurbishment. That way, you can get your crying out of the way before you get there if Pirates of the
      Caribbean
      is
      closed.
    </p>

    <h2>General Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Both parks offer lockers. The money is worth it because you won’t have to lug everything around all day.
      </li>
      <li>Fast Pass is a gift from God. Take the time to read about them in Birnbaum’s, and don’t hesitate to ask
        a
        cast member about anything that is confusing.
      </li>
      <li>I have not suggested when you should fit in eating. You will have to run this on your own schedule, but
        keep
        in mind that most people will want to eat at noon, so the restaurants get very crowded.
      </li>
      <li>Character meals are the BEST way to meet characters. They will come to your table for pictures, and you
        won’t have to push and shove. They are a little pricey but worth it. Goofy’s Kitchen is hands-down the
        best,
        but the Plaza Inn isn’t bad either. Goofy’s Kitchen offers all meals, and lunch is usually the least
        crowded. These can get pricey in a hurry.
      </li>
      <li>Early entry is sometimes an option. This allows you to get into the park about an hour before it
        normally
        opens, and there are specific rides running. If you can pry yourselves out of bed, this is a great way
        to
        ride a lot of rides with no waiting. I can’t stress enough how important it is to get to the parks as
        early
        as possible. By noon, they will be packed. This would be a great time to go to Goofy’s Kitchen (you
        might
        want to call for reservations), go to your hotel for a nap or take a dip in the pool.
      </li>
      <li>Some of the big rides have a “kid-switch program” (my term, not theirs) for little ones who are not big
        enough for some of the rides. This allows you to wait with a child while one of you rides the ride.
        Then, as
        one exits the ride and takes care of the kid, the other can go on the very next cycle. Ask the ride
        operators if this is an option.
      </li>
      <li>There will be cast members throughout the parks taking pictures. If they offer, let them. You are not
        obligated to buy anything, and you can see your pictures before you decide. If you see the photographers
        but
        they don’t see you, stop them and ask them to take your picture. These are sometimes the best pictures
        you
        will get, and they make great grandparent gifts. Great places to have them take your picture are in
        front of
        the Mickey flowers, the Walt and Mickey statue or in front of Sleeping Beauty’s Castle. There is usually
        someone there to take your picture with characters as well. They will even take a picture with your
        camera
        if you want.
      </li>
      <li>Don’t wait too long in line. You can always come back to that ride later.</li>
      <li>Let go of any reservations you might have about Disneyland being for kids. Let your guard down and…
